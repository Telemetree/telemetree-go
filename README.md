# Telemetree Go SDK

The Telemetree Python SDK provides a convenient way to track and analyze Telegram events using the Telemetree service. With this SDK, you can easily capture and send Telegram events to the Telemetree platform for further analysis and insights.

### Features

- Encrypt event data using a hybrid approach with RSA and AES encryption
- Customize the events and commands to track
- Simple and intuitive API for easy integration

### Installation

Install analytics-go using go get:

```shell
go get github.com/Telemetree/telemetree-go
```

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	
	"github.com/Telemetree/telemetree-go"
)

func main() {
	
	// Create a Telemetree SDK client by providing the Project ID and API Key
	client, err := telemetree.NewClient(
		"YOUR_PROJECT_ID",       // Unique identifier for your project
		"YOUR_API_KEY",          // API key for authentication
	)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error creating client:", err)
		return
	}

	// Send an event with user and event data
	err = client.Track(telemetree.Event{
		TelegramID: 112294972,     // User's Telegram ID (required)
		EventType:  "web",         // Event type (required)
		IsPremium:  true,          // Premium status flag (optional)

		// The following fields are optional:
		Username:     "username",  // Username
		Firstname:    "firstname", // First name
		Lastname:     "Lastname",  // Last name
		Language:     "en",        // User's language
		ReferrerType: "web",       // Traffic source type
		Referrer:     "0",         // Traffic source
	})

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error track event:", err)
		return
	}
}
```

### Errors handling
The client returns typed errors, which are specifically defined in the `github.com/TONSolutions/telemetree-go/telemetree/errors` package.
These custom error types provide more detailed information about specific error scenarios, making error handling more precise and informative.

The following error types are defined in the `github.com/TONSolutions/telemetree-go/telemetree/errors` package:
   - `ClientInitializationError`: Represents errors occurring during client initialization, with an associated reason.
   - `EventValidationError`: Represents validation errors for event fields, with the specific field that failed validation.
   - `EventPreparationError`: Represents errors during event preparation, including a description of the failure.
   - `EventSendError`: Represents errors encountered when sending events, with a description of the error.

You can use type assertion or `errors.As` to handle these errors in a type-safe manner and access the underlying details.


### Encryption

The SDK uses RSA encryption to secure event data before sending it to the Telemetree service, ensuring data privacy. The `publicKey` is fetched automatically from the Telemetree configuration service during initialization, so thereâ€™s no need to manually set it.

## Other SDKs
Telemetree SDKs are available for various frameworks and environments, making it easy to incorporate powerful analytics into any Telegram Mini App.
